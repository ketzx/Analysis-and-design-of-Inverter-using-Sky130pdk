# Analysis and Design of Inverter
### Design and Analysis of CMOS Inverter using the sky130 pdk and various open source tools
---
The main aim of this experiment is to understand working of a cmos inverter and all its parameters,the design we will do is present under Skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools like Xschem,NGspice

firstly,to make inverter we need nmos and pmos so we'll analize them(the standard module 1.8v which is present in the pdk).We have to do this as we want to determine W/L ratio, gm and similar values.
after all this we will work on the design of the cmos inverter which include measurment of various parameters like delay,noise margin,fall time rise time we will calculate this by SPICE tools programming capabilities
**Then we will engage in the design a layout for our inverter in __magic layout editor__. Here, we will also explore the different layers available to the user and how we utilise them in a design and what it translates to in terms of a mask. Lastly, we compare the two netlists, that is the schematic and the layout one, which is popularly referred to as ___LVS___. If everything is hunky-dory, this project would then conclude**
