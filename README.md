# Analysis and Design of Inverter Using sky130pdk
### Design and Analysis of CMOS Inverter using the sky130 pdk and various open source tools
---
The main aim of this experiment is to understand working of a cmos inverter and all its parameters,the design we will do is present under Skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools like Xschem,NGspice

firstly,to make inverter we need nmos and pmos so we'll analize them(the standard module 1.8v which is present in the pdk).We have to do this as we want to determine W/L ratio, gm and similar values.
after all this we will work on the design of the cmos inverter which include measurment of various parameters like delay,noise margin,fall time rise time we will calculate this by SPICE tools programming capabilities
**Then we will engage in the design a layout for our inverter in __magic layout editor__. Here, we will also explore the different layers available to the user and how we utilise them in a design and what it translates to in terms of a mask. Lastly, we compare the two netlists, that is the schematic and the layout one, which is popularly referred to as ___LVS___. If everything is hunky-dory, this project would then conclude**

## 1. Tools and PDK setup
### 1.1 Tools setup
For the design and simulation of our Inverter.
- Spice netlist simulation - [Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/)
- Layout Design and DRC - [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/)
- LVS - [Netgen](http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/)
- Schematic Capture - [Xschem](http://repo.hu/projects/xschem/)

#### 1.1.1 Ngspice 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49194847/138070431-d95ce371-db3b-43a1-8dbe-fa85bff53625.png)

[Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/devel.html) is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice is an open project, there is no closed group of developers.

[Ngspice Reference Manual](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf): Complete reference manual.

#### 1.1.2 Magic

 [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) is a VLSI layout tool.
 
**Steps to install Magic** - 
 Follow the instructions on the [Opencircuitdesign](https://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) Install section. I would suggest to use a couple options for the configuration file.
 
#### 1.1.3 Netgen
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49194847/138073573-a819cc67-7643-4ecf-983d-454d99ec5443.png)

[Netgen](http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/) is a tool for comparing netlists, a process known as LVS, which stands for "Layout vs. Schematic". This is an important step in the integrated circuit design flow, ensuring that the geometry that has been laid out matches the expected circuit.

**Steps to install Netgen** - Open the terminal and type the following to insatll Netgen.
```
$  git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen
$  cd netgen
$  ./configure
$  sudo make
$  sudo make install
```

#### 1.1.4 Xschem

[Xschem](http://repo.hu/projects/xschem/xschem_man/xschem_man.html) is a schematic capture program that allows to interactively enter an electronic circuit using a graphical and easy to use interface. When the schematic has been created a circuit netlist can be generated for simulation.

### 1.2 PDK setup

A process design kit (PDK) is a set of files used within the semiconductor industry to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit. The PDK is created by the foundry defining a certain technology variation for their processes. It is then passed to their customers to use in the design process.

The PDK we are going to use for this BGR is Google Skywater-130 (130 nm) PDK.

**Steps to download PDK** - Open the terminal and type the following to download sky130 PDK.
```
$  git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks.git
$  cd open_pdks
$  ./configure [options]
$  make
$  [sudo] make install
```

**I have used [this](https://youtu.be/VCuyO7Chvc8?feature=shared) video by a channel named whyRD to install all these softwares**

## 2. Analysis of MOSFET models

### 2.1 General MOS Analysis

In this section I start with our analysis of MOSFET models present in sky130 pdk. I will be using the 1.8v transistor models, below is the schematic I created in **Xschem**.

___highly recommended to check out the tutorials of xschem [here](http://repo.hu/projects/xschem/xschem_man/xschem_man.html) and ngspice [here](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf)___

![NMOS CHAR SCHEMATIC](./Images/nfet_for_vgs_vs_ids.png)

The components used are:<br>
```nfet_01v8.sym``` - from xschem_sky130 library<br>
```vsource.sym``` - from xschem devices library<br>
```code_shown.sym``` - from xschem devices library<br>

I used the above to plot the basic characteristic plots for an NMOS Transistor, That is ___Ids vs Vds___ and ___Ids vs Vgs___. To do that, just save the above circuit with the above mentioned specifications and component placement. After this just hit __Netlist__ then __Simulate__. ___ngspice___ would pop up and start doing the simulation based calculations. It will take time as all the libraries need to be called and attached to the simulation spice engine. Once that is done, you need to write a couple commands in the ngspice terminal:<br><br>
```display``` - This would display all the vectors available for plotting and printing.<br>
```setplot``` - This would list all the set of plots available for this simulation.<br>
_after this choose a plot by typing '''setplot <plot_name>'''. for example '''setplot tran1'''_<br>
```plot``` - to choose the vector to plot.<br>
_example : plot -vds#branch_<br><br>
